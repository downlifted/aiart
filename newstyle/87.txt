Batman stands vigil atop a rain-soaked rooftop in Gotham City, his cape billowing in the wind as he surveys the city below. The Gotham skyline looms in the background, a mix of towering skyscrapers and ominous shadows. Catwoman prowls nearby, her silhouette blending into the darkness as she plots her next heist. The Joker's laughter echoes through the night, a chilling reminder of the city's dangers. The atmosphere is gritty and atmospheric, capturing the dark and brooding aesthetic of Gotham City. Inspired by the iconic art of DC Comics and the noir-inspired visuals of Batman.
