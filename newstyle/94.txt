In a world made entirely of blocks, players explore, mine, and build to survive. They gather resources, craft tools and weapons, and construct elaborate structures to protect themselves from the dangers that lurk in the pixelated wilderness. With endless possibilities and a community of players creating their own adventures, Minecraft is a sandbox game that encourages creativity and exploration.
