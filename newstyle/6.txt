"Imagine a psychedelic artwork depicting a futuristic savannah where the wildlife, particularly zebras, has evolved into sophisticated robotic beings. Design a robotic zebra with sleek, metallic body panels that mimic the natural stripes of a zebra, using chrome and matte black finishes to define these features. Incorporate glowing elements, such as LED strips or light-up patterns, in various colors along the zebra's body to emphasize its robotic nature. The setting should be a high-tech savannah, with elements like digital grass and electronic trees that subtly glow under a twilight sky. Include details like circuit patterns on the ground and holographic foliage, creating an environment that merges the organic with the electronic. The robotic zebra should be shown interacting with this environment, perhaps grazing on digital grass or interacting with other robotic animals, showcasing a harmonious blend of nature and technology."
