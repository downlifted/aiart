A magical garden filled with oversized cannabis plants whose leaves sparkle with iridescent colors. The garden is bathed in a soft, otherworldly glow from floating orbs of light that drift through the air. The pathways are lined with glowing, rainbow-colored pebbles, and the flowers around the garden emit a gentle, hypnotic fragrance. In the center of the garden is a large, ancient tree with glowing roots that pulse with energy, and the entire scene seems to be alive with a mystical, trippy energy. This vibrant, surreal scene is inspired by the visionary art of artists like Alex Grey and the fantastical realms of Josephine Wall.
