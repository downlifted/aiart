A sprawling, neon-lit cityscape set against a dark, starry sky. Towering skyscrapers with sleek, angular designs are bathed in vibrant hues of pink, purple, and blue, their windows glowing with digital patterns. Futuristic vehicles zip through the air on elevated highways, leaving trails of neon light in their wake. Holographic advertisements and billboards flicker with retro-futuristic graphics, casting a surreal glow over the bustling streets below. The city's architecture blends elements of cyberpunk and retro-futurism, with sharp lines and bold colors. The entire scene pulses with the energy of the synthwave aesthetic, inspired by the neon-drenched, nostalgic works of artists like Syd Mead and the atmospheric visuals of films like "Blade Runner" and "Akira."
