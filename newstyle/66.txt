an epic art representing the essence of this poetic sentiment, abstract elements and influenced by renowned comic artists like jack kirby, Jim Lee or Geoff johns. Here are the source inspirational verses to use in constructing the render of the metaphorical hallucinogenic lucid vision this copy embodies. Use the spirit of the poem to establish the mythic visualization, tone, style and content: Old souls camped out, waiting. Stuck in a line, no resolution; spherical--an illusion.

Disarray, ranking; economics weigh me, dilettantes say. So many, I can’t find my way.
